# Matplotlib and Seaborn

A collection of resources and notebooks for working in and getting starting with matplotlib and seaborn library in Python.

Matplotlib and Seaborn are two popular data visualization libraries in Python. **Matplotlib** is a plotting library that provides a high-level interface for producing a variety of plots.

**Seaborn**, on the other hand, is a higher-level library built on top of Matplotlib that provides a more intuitive interface and better visualization style. 

While both Matplotlib and Seaborn provide similar functionality Seaborn provides a more intuitive and aesthetically pleasing approach to data visualization, while Matplotlib provides more control over the plot's appearance and flexibility in customizing the plot.

# Notebooks







## Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. 


### [Matplotlib Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/pavsingh7/Matplotlib/blob/main/matplot_cs.ipynb) 

A look at all the basic tools and methods in pandas - most of which I commonly use in data analysis.

### [Advanced Matplotlib](https://github.com/pavsingh7/Matplotlib/blob/main/matplot_adv.ipynb) 

A look at all the some more advanced visualization capabilities from matplotlib.

## Seaborn

Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics

## Pandas Plotting

### [Pandas Visualisation Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/pavsingh7/Matplotlib/blob/main/pandas_vs.ipynb) 

We look at pandas for plotting data. We cover very elementary charts and graphics and some options for these plots.

## Walk-through and Exercises

### [Titanic Dataset](https://github.com/pavsingh7/Matplotlib/blob/main/matplot_titanic.ipynb) 

We go through and explore the titanic data set using matplotlib and seaborn for data visualisation. Some data manipulation takes place, but we try to keep this to a minimum.

The work is best used in a code editor or online editor like Google Colab - linked below. Play around with the tools, download different data sets, try new things - get comfortable.
